Emotional Media Generator

When the page first displays it should look like:

Navbar: with Logo/Title maybe one page for images, one for videos, one for music, one for random, (change my mood)

User be able to input a mood/feeling/emotion or select from a drop down or buttons? ***UX decision

When the user selects a mood the selection gets hidden, and the return from the api covers it.

Then the api will do a search for images that match that mood and display them

*** extra feature** store history of what a user has looked at (image id stored in local storage)/select favorites

once the user selects a mood return 10? images that go into a carousel and at the end there is an option to get more photos, or change the mood input
